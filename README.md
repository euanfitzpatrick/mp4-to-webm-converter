# MP4 to WEBM Converter

A quick batch file script to convert all MP4 videos in a folder to WEBM format. Useful for having looping videos when livestreaming.


## Usage/Examples

To use this batch script, you will first need to download the FFMPEG codec.

You can download this from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

You will need to ensure that the ffmpeg executable is in `C:\Program Files\Common Files\ffmpeg\bin\`.

Once everything is installed and configured, just run `MP4toWEBM.bat` in the same directory as all of the MP4 files you wish to convert.

The script will convert all videos to WEBM format and leave them in the same directory, and move all old `*.mp4` videos to a new directory called `old`.
